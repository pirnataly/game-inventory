# Game-inventory

### React + TypeScript + Vite

Educational project. The main goal is to design the inventory interface for a video game using react components.\
Inventory is a grid of cells of a fixed size (for example, 12x8).\
Items can be of different types (potions, equipment, weapons),\
of different rarities (common, rare, epic) and \
have different sizes: 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 3x1, 2x2.\
The type and rarity of the item should be displayed on it by color or icon.\
The inventory should be loaded from a json file.\

There are 3 jsons files are prepared for validation check:

1) data1 - normal inventory arrangement

2) data2 - the last item (item25) has intersection with the previous one (item24).

3) data3 - the last item (item36) is outside the grid.
